## Sun Seeker
### Intro
In the world of Sun Seeker, the sun lives on top of a temple. One day, the sun shatters into many sun shards that are spread throughout this temple. You play as a little moth person determined to ascend the temple, collect the sun shards, and revive the sun. Sun Seeker is a 3D platformer played on the PC. As you explore an interconnected map, you gain abilities that help you ascend the temple. Solve puzzles, conquer difficult platforming, and piece the sun back together.
